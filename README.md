# Raft Consensus
[Project Spec](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~chase/cps310/p3.html)<br />

## Overview
The goal of this project is to implement two parts of the Raft consensus protocol. 

In the first part of the project, we implement the leader-election protocol. In the second part, we implement the log-repair protocol.

We used the [Raft](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~chase/cps310/internal/papers/raft.pdf) discussion paper as a guide for the project.
